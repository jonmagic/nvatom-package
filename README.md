# nvatom

**This is a work in progress, features described aren't necessarily implemented yet.**

This Atom package is all about taking notes and then using what you've written. From journal entries, to emails, to lists, nvatom makes writing and using your notes simple and fast.

Navigate your notes like you surf the web. The search bar at the top is universal search for your notes and the search results are displayed instantly with each key press.

Create rich notes with Markdown and take things a step further with GitHub Flavored Markdown and features like Task Lists. View your rendered note in realtime as you type or toggle between edit and view modes.

Selectively publish notes as public or private [Gists](https://gist.github.com).

nvatom was inspired by [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net) and [nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) and is built on top of [Atom](https://atom.io).

## TODO

- [x] build model for storing, listing, and searching documents
- [x] watch path for file changes
- [ ] build html/css layout (search/create, list, editor)
- [ ] live update document list when files update
- [ ] use Atom editor for editing files
